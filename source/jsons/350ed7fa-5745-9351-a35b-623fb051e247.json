{"title":"US Visas","endpoint":"Sam Altman","description":"\n                         We’ve heard from some founders that they’re nervous about applying to YC because they worry they won’t be able to get visas to attend interviews or the summer program.\nWe will hold a day of interviews in Vancouver for founders we’d like to interview but can’t get US visas. We will also experiment with allowing companies that we’d like to fund but are unable to get visas for the duration of our three-month program to participate remotely.\nWe provide immigration assistance and advice, and we try to help find ways for everyone we want to fund to be able to come here. While we understand that remote work works really well for some companies and some programs, we don’t think it’s optimal for our semi-annual batches.\nOur goal is to fund the most talented founders in the world, no matter where they live. We think it’s an incredible asset for our country that so many of the best people in the world want to come start their companies here.\n                                             "}
