{"title":"Amazon EC2","endpoint":"http://ec2.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-06-26/AmazonEC2.wsdl","description":"\n              The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) API is a web service that enables you to launch and manage Linux/UNIX and Windows server instances in Amazon's data centers. Giving users the ability to \"compute\" in the cloud, it provides users with complete control of their computing resources and lets them run on Amazon's computing environment. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing users to pay only for capacity that is actually used.\r\n\r\nAmazon EC2 provides two APIs: SOAP and REST. The same XML body is returned in both the REST API and SOAP API. The WSDL for each supported API version is available from the following URI:\r\n\r\nhttp://ec2.amazonaws.com/doc//AmazonEC2.wsdl \r\n\r\nThe WSDL should be treated as a moving target as it will always map to the latest release of the Amazon EC2 SOAP API.
